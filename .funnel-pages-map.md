## UTM Tracking Strategy

Each landing page should be accessed via UTM parameters to track source:

**Real Estate Investors (portfolio-clarity.html):**
- Paid Ads: `?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=rei_acquisition`
- Email: `?utm_source=email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=rei_nurture`
- Social: `?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=rei_awareness`
- Referral: `?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=rei_partner_xyz`
- Cold Call: `?utm_source=outbound&utm_medium=phone&utm_campaign=rei_cold_outreach`

**Construction & Trades (trade-advantage.html):**
- Similar structure with `construction_` campaign prefix

**E-Commerce & Retail (retail-systems.html):**
- Similar structure with `ecommerce_` campaign prefix

**Home Services (service-mastery.html):**
- Similar structure with `homeservices_` campaign prefix

**Cash Flow Mastery (cash-flow-mastery.html):**
- Paid Ads: `?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=cashflow_acquisition`
- Email: `?utm_source=email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=cashflow_nurture`
- Social: `?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=cashflow_awareness`

## Content Strategy

Each page follows Sabri Suby's "Sell Like Crazy" framework:
1. Interrupt - Pain-driven headline
2. Engage - Industry-specific pain points
3. Why Traditional Solutions Fail - Build unique mechanism
4. Solution - The TechPro Financial Advantage System (customized per industry)
5. How It Works - 4-step process
6. Social Proof - Success story with quantifiable results
7. Guarantee - 90-Day Financial Clarity Guarantee
8. Urgency - Limited spots, seasonal timing
9. Strong CTA - Free assessment with specific deliverables

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Video Integration
- [ ] Record HVCO (High-Value Content Offer) presentation video
- [ ] Record consultation sales video
- [ ] Integrate videos into landing pages (above or within solution section)

### Phase 3: HVCO Creation (per industry)
- [ ] REI HVCO: "The 7 Hidden Profit Leaks in Your Property Portfolio" (PDF/Video)
- [ ] Construction HVCO: "Job Costing Mastery: The 5-Step System to Never Lose Money on a Job" (PDF/Video)
- [ ] E-Commerce HVCO: "Product Profitability Blueprint: How to Identify Your Winning SKUs" (PDF/Video)
- [ ] Home Services HVCO: "The Technician Profitability Formula: Maximize Revenue Per Truck" (PDF/Video)

### Phase 4: Additional Landing Page Variants

**Generic Catch-All** (for non-industry-specific traffic):
- [ ] `financial-clarity-system.html` - Generic version emphasizing the TechPro Financial Advantage System without industry focus

**Problem-Based** (alternative segmentation):
- [ ] `cash-flow-mastery.html` - For businesses struggling with cash flow regardless of industry
- [ ] `scaling-systems.html` - For businesses ready to scale but lacking financial visibility

**Size-Based** (alternative segmentation):
- [ ] `small-business-clarity.html` - For businesses under $1M revenue
- [ ] `growing-business-advantage.html` - For businesses $1M-$5M ready to scale

## A/B Testing Strategy

Compare click-through and conversion rates:
1. Industry-specific vs Generic catch-all
2. Industry-specific vs Problem-based
3. Identify which segmentation approach performs best

## Notes

- URLs are intentionally obscure to avoid pattern detection
- All pages emphasize the complete TechPro Financial Advantage System, not just bookkeeping
- Each page has industry-specific terminology and pain points
- HubSpot tracking enabled on all pages for conversion tracking
- All dates updated to reference 2026 (January 2026 onboarding, "don't start 2026 with 2025's problems")
